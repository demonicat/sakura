# Optional TFS Side Changes
These are things that Sakura implemented that aren't implemented in TFS, or we didn't know it was implemented there. Sakura will keep working without these, but to enjoy our full experience these are highly recommendable. Note that these aren't walk throughs about how to implement it in TFS, just the steps we used implementing it in Sakura.
